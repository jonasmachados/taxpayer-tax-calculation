<h1 align="center"> Taxpayer tax calculation </h1>

<p> Program to read the data of N taxpayers (N provided by the user), which can be a individual or company,and
then show the value of tax paid by each, as well as the total tax collected
</p> 
 
<p>The data of individual are: name, anual income and health expenditures. the data of company are name, anual income and number of employees. The rules for calculating taxes are the following:
</p>

 <p><b> Individual:</b>  people whose income is below 20000.00 paid 15% of income. People with income from 20 onwards pay. If the people had health expenses, 50% of these expenses are deducted from the tax.
<b> example:</b>  a people whose income was  50000.00 and had 2000.00 in health expenses, the tax stays:
(50000 * 25%) - (2000 * 50%) = 11500.00
</p>

<p><b> Company:</b>  company pay 16% of tax. although, if the company can more that 10 employees, she pay 14% of tax.
<b> example:</b>  a company whose income was 400000.00 and can 25 employees, the tax stays:
400000 * 14% = 56000.00
